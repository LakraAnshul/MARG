## Overview

M.A.R.G. is an intelligent traffic management system that leverages computer vision and machine learning to analyze urban traffic congestion, detect bottlenecks, and optimize traffic flow. Our solution provides real-time monitoring and actionable insights for traffic authorities.


## Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion leads to significant economic losses, environmental impact, and decreased quality of life. Traditional traffic management methods often fall short in effectiveness and real-time responsiveness.

### Key Challenges:
- **Sub-Problem 1:** Evaluating traffic congestion shown by map engine services against actual congestion measured via drone footage
- **Sub-Problem 2:** Optimizing and evaluating junction performance with optimal signal timing
- **Sub-Problem 3:** Detecting traffic bottlenecks and generating real-time alerts

## Solution

We developed an object detection-based system using advanced computer vision components. By leveraging pre-trained models like YOLOv8 and supervision toolkit, our system can automatically detect and geo-reference bottlenecks and road congestions from images captured by onboard cameras in real-time.
